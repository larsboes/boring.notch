# Architecture Overview

> **Note:** This document reflects the system architecture as of January 2026 (v1.0 Plugin System).

Boring Notch is a macOS application designed to transform the static camera notch into a dynamic, interactive utility hub. The architecture is built on a **modular, plugin-first** foundation, ensuring extensibility, testability, and separation of concerns.

## 🏗 System Context (C4 Level 1)

At the highest level, boringNotch sits between the user, the macOS system, and external services.

```mermaid

    User((User))
    
    subgraph "macOS Environment"
        SystemAudio[CoreAudio / Media APIs]
        SystemEvents[EventKit / Notifications]
        IOKit[IOKit / Battery]
        
        BN[Boring Notch App]
    end
    
    User <-->|Clicks/Hovers| BN

    BN <-->|Reads| IOKit
    
    BN -->|Displays| Screen[Screen / Notch Area]
```

## 🧩 Container Architecture (C4 Level 2)

The application is divided into three main layers: **Core Infrastructure**, **Plugin Engine**, and **Feature Plugins**.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Core Infrastructure"
        AppDelegate[AppDelegate]
        WindowCoord[WindowCoordinator]
        StateMachine[NotchStateMachine]
        ContentRouter[NotchContentRouter]
    end

    subgraph "Plugin Engine"
        PM[PluginManager]
        SC[ServiceContainer]
        EventBus[PluginEventBus]
    end

    subgraph "Feature Plugins"
        Music[MusicPlugin]
        Battery[BatteryPlugin]
        Shelf[ShelfPlugin]
        Other[...Other Plugins]
    end

    %% Wiring
    AppDelegate --> WindowCoord
    AppDelegate --> PM
    
    PM -->|Manages| Music
    PM -->|Manages| Battery
    PM -->|Manages| Shelf
    
    PM --> SC
    PM --> EventBus
    
    Music -.->|Injects| SC
    Battery -.->|Injects| SC
    
    WindowCoord -->|Observes| StateMachine
    StateMachine -->|Computes State| ContentRouter
    ContentRouter -->|Renders| Music
```

### Key Components

1.  **PluginManager**: The brain of the extension system. It manages the lifecycle (load, activate, deactivate) of all plugins and acts as the central registry.
2.  **ServiceContainer**: A dependency injection container that holds all system services (`MusicService`, `BatteryService`, etc.). Plugins request services from here.
3.  **NotchStateMachine**: A pure logic component that determines *what* should be shown on the screen based on various inputs (is music playing? is battery low? is user hovering?).
4.  **NotchContentRouter**: The View layer component that maps the State Machine's output to actual SwiftUI views.

---

## 🧠 State Determination & Routing

One of the most complex parts of the system is deciding what to show in the closed notch. The system uses a **Priority-Based Arbitration** mechanism.

### The "Display Request" Flow

Plugins do not simply "draw" to the screen. They must **request** to be displayed.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant System as MusicService
    participant Plugin as MusicPlugin
    participant PM as PluginManager
    participant SM as NotchStateMachine
    participant Router as NotchContentRouter
    participant UI as Screen

    System->>Plugin: Playback Started (Event)
    Plugin->>Plugin: Update Internal State
    
    note over Plugin: displayRequest changes to:\n{ priority: .high, category: .music }
    
    Plugin->>PM: (Implicitly observed via @Observable)
    
    loop Every Render Cycle
        SM->>PM: highestPriorityClosedNotchPlugin()
        PM->>Plugin: Check displayRequest
        PM-->>SM: Returns "com.boringnotch.music"
        
        SM->>SM: Compute State: .closed(content: .plugin("...music"))
        SM-->>Router: Update State
    end
    
    Router->>PM: closedNotchView(for: "com.boringnotch.music")
    PM->>Plugin: closedNotchContent()
    Plugin-->>UI: Renders MusicLiveActivity
```

### Priority Levels

1.  **Critical (30)**: Urgent system warnings (e.g., "Battery Low").
2.  **High (20)**: Active user engagement (e.g., "Music Playing", "Timer Running").
3.  **Normal (10)**: Passive information (e.g., "Weather").
4.  **Background (0)**: Idle state.

## 🚥 Notch State Machine Logic

The `NotchStateMachine` is the single source of truth for the notch's visual mode.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    
    state Closed {
        [*] --> Idle
        Idle --> ActivePlugin: Plugin Request (High/Crit)
        ActivePlugin --> Idle: Request Ended
        
        Idle --> SneakPeek: Short Hover
        SneakPeek --> Idle: Hover Ended
        
        Idle --> InlineHUD: System Event (Vol/Bright)
        InlineHUD --> Idle: Timeout
    }
    
    state Open {
        [*] --> Home
        Home --> ExpandedPanel: Select Plugin
        ExpandedPanel --> Home: Back
    }
    
    Closed --> Open: Click / Long Hover / Drag Down
    Open --> Closed: Click Outside / Drag Up
```

## 📡 Inter-Plugin Communication

Plugins are isolated by default but can communicate via the `PluginEventBus`. This decouples producers from consumers.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Music[MusicPlugin] -->|Emits: .playbackChanged| Bus[PluginEventBus]
    Shelf[ShelfPlugin] -->|Emits: .fileDropped| Bus
    
    Bus -->|Notifies| Visualizer[VisualizerPlugin]
    Bus -->|Notifies| Analytics[AnalyticsService]
    
    Visualizer -.->|Reacts to| Music
```

*   **Example**: The `VisualizerPlugin` doesn't need to know about `MusicPlugin`. It just listens for `playbackChanged` events on the bus.

---

## ⚡️ Concurrency Model

Structured concurrency (`async/await`) and Actors are strictly used to ensure thread safety.

| Component | Isolation | Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **NotchPlugin** | `@MainActor` | Plugins directly drive UI state, so they must stay on the main thread. |
| **Services** | `@MainActor` | Most system APIs (EventKit, etc.) are main-thread bound or updated via UI run loops. |
| **Workers** | `Task` / `actor` | Heavy lifting (image processing, network requests) is offloaded to background tasks. |

**Key Rule**: The main thread must never be blocked. If a plugin needs to fetch data (e.g., Weather), it must spawn a detached `Task`.

---

## 💾 Persistence Strategy

Plugins are sandboxed. `UserDefaults.standard` is not accessed directly.

*   **`PluginSettings`**: A wrapper around `Defaults` that namespaces keys.
    *   Plugin ID: `com.boringnotch.weather`
    *   Key: `showTemperature`
    *   Actual UserDefaults Key: `plugin.com.boringnotch.weather.showTemperature`

This prevents key collisions and facilitates resetting a specific plugin without wiping the entire app settings.

---

## 🔄 Data Flow Patterns

**Unidirectional Data Flow** is strictly adhered to.

1.  **System Event**: A system event occurs (e.g., Song changed).
2.  **Service Update**: The `MusicService` updates its `@Observable` properties.
3.  **Plugin Reaction**: The `MusicPlugin` (observing the service) updates its own state.
4.  **UI Render**: SwiftUI detects the change in the Plugin and re-renders the View.

**❌ Anti-Pattern (Avoid):**
*   Views observing singletons (`MusicManager.shared`).
*   Plugins directly modifying Views.

**✅ Correct Pattern:**
*   Views observe `Plugin`.
*   Plugin observes `Service`.
*   Service observes `System`.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The architecture is designed for testability.

*   **Unit Tests**: Plugins are tested in isolation by injecting **Mock Services**.
*   **Mocking**: Every Service is defined by a protocol (e.g., `MusicServiceProtocol`), allowing the injection of fake implementations that return controlled data.

### Example: Testing Music Display Logic

```swift
func testMusicPluginRequestsDisplay() async {
    // 1. Setup
    let mock = MockMusicService()
    let plugin = MusicPlugin()
    await plugin.activate(context: ...services: [music: mock]...)
    
    // 2. Action
    mock.playbackState.isPlaying = true
    
    // 3. Assertion
    XCTAssertEqual(plugin.displayRequest?.priority, .high)
}
```
